# Wlodzimiers Blocks
Wlodzimiers Blocks is a server-side mod that **plans to add** various custom blocks by using a <a src="https://github.com/Patbox/polymer">Polymer</a> library by <a src="https://modrinth.com/user/Patbox">Patbox</a>
---
Currently, it only adds one block, Kitchen Tiles, which you can see in the gallery tab.

We plan on adding many new blocks, so stay tuned for that!

<p>"Wlodzimiers" is an inside joke in our (mine and selnov's) relationship. It's basically a misspelling of her cat's name "WÅ‚odzimierz" who's featured as this mod's icon!
